This is a pure usd plugin that is a shaders discovery plugin.
The shaders defined inshadersDef.usda will be loaded by usd/hydra and available for use in a material network in any Hydra plugin.

You can add the plugInfo.json file path in the environment variable PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME or use another .json file to load it
so USD/Hydra loads it at startup.
